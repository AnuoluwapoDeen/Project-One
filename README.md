Detailed Information

As part of my certification requirement for the CoRise SQL crash course, I completed two projects aimed at enhancing my data analysis skills using SQL queries. In these projects, I assumed the role of General Manager for Sydney Airbnb and delved deep into the different listings of houses onboarded by my team.
By querying various datasets such as listings, neighborhoods, reviews, and calendar data, I extracted valuable insights that helped me assess the market performance of our properties. These queries enabled me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Airbnb landscape in Sydney, which, in turn, aided me in making data-driven decisions that improved our business strategy.
This experience helped me recognize the power of data analysis in driving business growth and development, as well as the pivotal role of technology in revolutionizing the hospitality industry.
